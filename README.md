This repository contains a TypeScript code example that demonstrates an uncommon type error: 'Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'number'. This error occurs when a function is declared to return void, but the return type is implicitly inferred as number. The issue arises from a function that returns void early using a return statement within a loop, and the function's return type is incorrectly inferred as number instead of void by the TypeScript compiler.  This often occurs when a function that is intended to return void unexpectedly terminates early.
